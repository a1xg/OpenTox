                            OpenTox makes it easy to assess the health risks of a particular food or cosmetic product using
                            complex calculations based on a large amount of scientific toxicological data, and converting
                            this data into understandable and simple risk ratings for each ingredient and product as a whole.
                            You don't have to google and read the wikipedia articles for each ingredient, we will do it for you.

                            The OpenTox rating is calculated based on data from the GHS system.
                            The rating of an ingredient is calculated as an arithmetically weighted average, taking into
                            account the hazard class for humans, the level of hazard within the class.
                            The rating of a product is calculated as the arithmetic average of the rating of its ingredients.

                                </Link>, developed by the United Nations, as our criteria for assessing health hazards.
                                The GHS system was created due to the fact that different countries of the world have
                                their own systems and criteria for assessing the hazard of chemical components.

                                In the era of global international trade, substances prohibited for use in one country, for
                                example, due to carcinogenicity, could be safely used in another country, which caused a
                                lot of confusion and health risks for end users.

                                </Link> regulation based on the GHS system was introduced for the EU countries in 2008.
                                <br/>
                                The CLP regulation obliges manufacturers and importers of chemicals and their mixtures (products)
                                to include on their packaging information on possible health and environmental risks in accordance
                                with the GHS system.
                                <br/>
                                Also, the regulation obliges to register information about risks in a special public
                                <Link href='https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/cl-inventory-database/'> register</Link>,
                                in which the data are aggregated and allow to objectively, impartially and as democratic as
                                possible assess the risks of a particular substance, to avoid errors in classification.
                            
                                <br/>
                                Unfortunately, in the CLP regulation, cosmetic products have a special status and their
                                manufacturers are not yet obliged to put risk information on the packaging according to the GHS.
                                The introduction of the GHS system for cosmetic products and the requirement for labeling on
                                packaging is currently under discussion and is in its infancy.
                                State organizations exercising control over the use of cosmetics ingredients usually only
                                state the use of certain components by manufacturers, but prohibiting manufacturers from
                                using an unsafe component turns out to be a difficult task, requiring long-term scientific
                                research confirming the harmful effects on human health. The situation with E-supplements
                                is a little better, however, some of them were allowed decades ago, but then were banned
                                in many countries around the world, when there was a sufficient amount of scientific evidence
                                about their dangers.
                                <br/>
                            Thus, for today manufacturers and importers of cosmetics:
                            Are not required to affix hazard labels to ingredients.
                            Can use in production any component that has not yet been legally prohibited, but for which the
                            risks have long been known<Link href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-4715-24-37' >
